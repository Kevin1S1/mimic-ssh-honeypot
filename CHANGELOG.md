## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02

Initial release.

### Added
- Escape-proof SSH honeypot emulating a Debian 12 server via a pure
  state-machine architecture — no `std::process`, no real filesystem access
  in the emulation layer, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` project-wide.
- ~30 emulated shell commands with readline-style line editing, history,
  MOTD, and `/proc` fakes.
- In-memory virtual filesystem bounded by node count (10k) and total
  content size (64 MiB).
- SCP upload support with configurable size cap (16 MiB default) and
  quarantine store for captured payloads.
- Structured JSON logging of sessions, credentials, and commands.
- Connection hardening: global and per-IP connection limits enforced
  before crypto, session and idle timeouts, bounded line/exec/output
  lengths.
- Docker deployment: distroless non-root runtime, read-only rootfs,
  dropped capabilities, resource limits.
- CI: clippy (`-D warnings`), full test suite, cargo-deny supply-chain
  audit with weekly scheduled run.
